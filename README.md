# ActionClassification
Action Classification on Breakfast Dataset using Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN)

The goal of this project was to classify each segment from the Breakfast dataset to any of the 47 sub-actions (excluding SIL). 

I have used two Action Classification models - 
* Encoder- Decoder Temporal Convolutional Network (ED-TCN)
* Multi - Stage Temporal Convolutional Network (MS-TCN)


The sole purpose of this project was to explore various TCN models for Action Classification task.
